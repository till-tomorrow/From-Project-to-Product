# From-Project-to-Product
As a developer, I always search for people who can possibly help me build my project. It's hard to get the code noticed, when there are millions of projects available already. It's hard to differentiate between a good and a bad project. It's hard to get the objective and the vision of the project.

It is an attempt to build a platform to meet fellow people who are interested in your project and can contribute to make it a product. 

All you have to do is to send the link to your project's github repo with a suitable project description and the the skills required to complete the project(as a PR)! Feel free to contribute.

All the best. Happy coding!
